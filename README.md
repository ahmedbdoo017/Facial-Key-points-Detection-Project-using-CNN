* **Facial-Key-points-Detection-Project-using-CNN**
  The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for 
  accurate detection ,The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to make it user-friendly This 
  can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:
  
      * tracking faces in images and video
      * analysing facial expressions
      * detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
      * biometrics / face recognition



* **Technologies Used Programming Language:**
*  Python
*  Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras (for the CNN model), OpenCV (for image processing), Tkinter (for the GUI), NumPy
*
